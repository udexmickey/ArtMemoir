  'NFTs & Art': [
    `Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are blockchain assets that distinguish them-
    selves from digital currencies like Bitcoin because every NFT is unique. This
    means they can represent something in the physical world, or in this case,
    art.`,

    `Artists typically don't receive a cut of secondary sales in the traditional art
    is a valuable item that otherwise wouldn't have been accessible for some-
    one to own, now they can own a piece of it. Custody of a physical item still
    requires a trustworthy custodian, but being able to issue, hold, and trade it
    as a crypto asset unlocks more use cases. One can also craft an NFT such
    that the creator receives a percentage of all secondary sales in a completely
    automated way.`,

    `The artist could also set specific parameters for how each license is used
    such as selling/reselling the license, using it for commercial purposes, or if
    you can alter the art that was created with the license. This will allow artists
    to track how their art is being used and could potentially give them a source
    of income that is more stable than the volatility of the cryptocurrency market
    and also encourage other artists to create similar FT artwork.`,

    `•With NFTs, you can register your artwork to an Ethereum address that is
    connected to an artist's identity. This will allow artists to track their art
    without having to worry about losing it. It would also limit the amount of
    counterfeit art that could be sold as authentic original artwork because all
    the originals would be traceable,`,

    `However, ArtMemoir has already listed its SIGNLE NFTs on Binance Smart
    chain network (BNB) in a notable marketplace like Afen Marketplace to limit
    gas fees and also make transactions smooth and safer for its Investors and
    Partners also ArtMemoir will be listing more NFTs on various smart chain that
    qualifies its community demand.`,

  'NFTs & Real Estate': [
    `Africa's population will grow from 1.3 billion to over 4 billion by 2100. It al-
    ready has a housing shortage. "The time has come for property players to
    look into NFTs as a realistic and practical solution to circumvent the pain
    points that have been plaguing the industry for decades," said Damodharan
    Vijayaragavan`,

    `Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can also be used in the real estate industry. An
    FT is a unique and verifiable representation of something that has value,
    ownership to one piece of property or multiple properties.
    ArtMemoir's NFT + DEF ecosystem features
    • Simplified complex real estate transaction processes
    • Shortened traditional real estate transaction processes from 4 months to few minutes
    transactions.`,

    `• Ease of managing collateral due to traceability of ownership
    • Real estate lending options that are lower than locally accessible rates
    Applying NFTs to blockchain; NFTs are non-fungible tokens or simply put
    digital assets in form of art, music, photograph etc. applying this technology
    might be of two forms:`,

    `A. Converting real estate projects/designs to NFTs; having them in
    collections to raise capital for the projects - when the project is executed
    investors that have these NFTs can decide to use it as a means either to
    make returns by selling it back OR giving it out on lease. This means that
    the NFTs will serve as a proof of ownership for a particular property.
    B. Application of Art to NFTs: Artmemoir plays a part in converting real time
    African monastery buildings already converted to NFTs, to promote the
    almost outdated African Art in buildings in order to revive these Projects
    and Culture.`,

    `NFTs can also be used to create these trustless transactions between two
    parties, by recording contracts on the blockchain. This would replace the
    need to use a third party such as Banks or Attorneys. An NFT could
    potentially be used to represent Titles of homeownership, which is
    typically what people purchase with their mortgages.
    N.b: Crypto related transactions are trustless in as much as invoices and
    deals are recorded on the blockchain`,

    ` NFTs in the Real Estate Market helps to figure out who owns what and how
    it can be transferred from person to person without going through a third
    party. People need to have a clear understanding of how they work and
    that they have value outside of being used as a digital currency. The
    benefits of NFTs outweigh the costs, so they are of great value in real
    estate transactions.`,

    `NFTs can be used to track ownership and royalties, which is useful for all
    types of creative industries, including the real estate industry.
    Here is what Larry Sanger has to say about NFTs use case in the real estate
    industry`,

    `"Buying real estate is going to move from being this massive technical un-
    dertaking that individuals don't understand. to something super easy."
    Larry Sanger, Co-founder of Wikipedia`,

  'NFTs & Games': [
    `NFTs have been a major force in the gaming industry's development.
    Non-fungible tokens have elevated the game to an entirely new level!
    Features that GameFi differs from traditional gaming:`,

    `• Ownership of assets: In GameFi, through on-chain smart contracts, the game's assets
    belong to the player rather than the developer.
    • Tradable assets in crypto markets: With the ownership of the assets, players can
    trade these assets, either NFT or tokens, in the open Crypto markets with other players.
    • Transparent data: All GameFi game codes are open source and transparent, and
    developers cannot simply change these codes. A player can also participate in-game
    upgrades and changes via a DAO, giving them a greater degree of participation.
    Current Status of GameFi`,

    `Despite its promise, there are still several major problems most projects
    face in the GameFi industry. As an investor, you should assess the projects
    based on their likelihood of overcoming these challenges.
    GameFi's prosperity on BSC`,

    `According to Dappradar, BSC has occupied 4 spots in the top 10 games.
    With almost 6 times the TPS(Transactions Per Second) of Ethereum, contin-
    ues to make a push in the GameFi with195 game projects already deployed
    on BSC`,

    `Although Ethereum occupies the majority of the overall TVL the low transac-
    tion speed and the problem of high gas fees have become obstacles for
    ordinary users to enter the blockchain world.`,

  Abstract: [
    `The popularity of NFTs and crypto-art is currently on the rise, opening new
    possibilities for visual artists, musicians, and animators alike. Utilizing this
    technology gives creators the ability to expand their networks, certify their
    work, and create and share pieces instantaneously compared to traditional
    formats. This new wave of technology could unlock new potentials in
    artwork utility, movement, collaboration, and provenance for work.`,

    `In today's economy, it can often be difficult to find someone or something
    that speaks to one's own heritage- ArtMemoir ensures this experience with
    every item we sell. Providing an opportunity for artists in all genres has been
    proven time and again to be a way of celebrating life in its fullest sense
    while at the same time helping spread and educate cultures across our
    global society.`,

    `Using a select criteria, ArtMemoir features artwork from a variety of both
    rising and well established digital artists who specifically compose a limited
    number of pieces and editions. Our website (www.artmemoir.org) offers
    direct access to live auctions and links to the platforms selling each piece.
    Customers also have access to the secondary market through Art Memoir's
    personal collection. The secondary market is composed of NFTs that have
    already dropped and sold to personal collections.`,

    `Accordingly, the core mission of Art Memoir is on the Exploration of Art
    beyond just beautification through NFTs. We are lovers of art and supporters
    of Artists; promoting various cultures/tribes of the world through our arts, but

    artworks, staking, yield farming, and Real Estate functions.
    Currently, our NFTs have been sectioned into single NFTs and Collection
    NFTs, all of which have value to our investors, Partners, Community, and the
    World of Art globally,`,

    `Having various artists at heart, our Single NFTs are mainly to support the art-
    ists while our Collection NFTs are designed to give our investors and part
    ners value that can be used in real-time. These NFTs will be used as a
    medium of transactions, stakes, shares, and lots more. Here, art won't just be
    used only for beautifications and preserving the cultural heritage of the
    people or the art they represent but will also be used in real-time situations
    without being controlled by a centralized organization or a third party, this
    will be achieved through the use of Blockchain Technology.`,

    all types of creative industries, including the real estate industry.
