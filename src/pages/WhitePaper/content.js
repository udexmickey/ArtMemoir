  Abstract: `We are a group of artists and digital creators that creates arts of various
cultures, Tribes, and indifferent art spaces minted in NFTs. Our Focus is on the
Exploration of Art beyond just beautification through NFTs.
As great lovers of art and supporters of artists. We are promoting various
cultures/tribes of the world through our arts, but not limited to popular tribes or
cultures.
Our NFTs have been sectioned into single NFTs and Collection NFTs, all of which
have value to our Investors, Partners, Community, and the World of Art globally.
Having various artists at heart, our single NFT is mainly to support the artists
while our collection NFTs are designed to give our investors and partners value
that can be used in real-time.
These NFTs will be used as a medium of transactions, stakes, shares, and lots
more. Here art won’t just be used only for beatifications and preserving the
cultural heritage of the people or the art they represent but will also be used inreal-time situations without being controlled by a centralized organization or a
third party, this will be achieved through the use of Blockchain.
ArtMemoir is a mix between a blockchain startup and an art gallery. We provide
physical, tangible, immutable artwork on our platform to those looking for cultural
representation from around the world as well as help with auctioning off some of
the most popular pieces. We are your best choice.
In today's economy, it can often be difficult to find someone or something that
speaks to one's own heritage- ArtMemoir ensures this experience with every item
we sell. Providing an opportunity for artists in all genres has been proven time
and again to be a way of celebrating life in its fullest sense while at the same
time helping spread and educate cultures across our global society.
In showcasing artists from all corners of the globe, ArtMemoir offers the
opportunity for collectors to amass a diverse portfolio of artwork - while also
supporting burgeoning talent and enabling entrepreneurship in some of the
neediest economies.`,
  'NFTs & Art': `Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are blockchain assets that distinguish themselves
from digital currencies like Bitcoin because every NFT is unique. This means
they can represent something in the physical world, or in this case, art.
Well-known implementations of nonfungible tokens in the art industry are
CryptoKitties and OpenSea.
CryptoKitties was the first game to utilize NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.
This game allowed users to buy, sell, and breed virtual cats that were
represented by ERC-721 tokens (non fungible tokens). Each CryptoKitty had its
own set of genetic traits which made each of them unique. CryptoKitties was so
popular that it slowed down the Ethereum blockchain, making it unusable for
transactions. The game successfully demonstrated how NFTs can be used to
represent something in the physical world (art) and also showed its potential
usage on the blockchain.
OpenSea is an online marketplace that allows users to buy NFTs from other
players. Since each NFT is unique, it can be difficult to find the right buyer for
your NFT if you want to sell it. This decentralized marketplace was created to
solve this problem by making it easier for players (or artists) to buy and sell their
NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.
CryptoKitties and OpenSea are just two examples of how NFTs can be used in
the art industry, there are still many unexplored possibilities of what NFTs can do
for artists. One unexplored use case is being able to know who has your artwork
from a verified address. When art is made with NFTs, you can register your
artwork to an Ethereum address that is connected to an artist's identity. This will
allow artists to track their art without having to worry about losing it. It would also
limit the amount of counterfeit art that could be sold as authentic original artwork
because all the originals would be traceable. However, ArtMemoir will be listing
its NFTs on Binance Smart chain network in notable marketplace like afen to limitgas fees and also make transactions smooth and safer for its investors and
partners.
NFTs can also help artists by allowing them to sell unique digital licenses instead
of selling the artwork itself. The artist could set specific parameters for how each
license is used such as selling/reselling the license, using it for commercial
purposes, or if you can alter the art that was created with the license. This will
allow artists to track how their art is being used and could potentially give them a
source of income that is more stable than the volatility of the cryptocurrency
market and also encourage other artists to create similar NFT artwork.
NFTs can also help reduce human error in authenticating art by allowing users to
verify authenticity through the blockchain address that created the artwork. This
will remove any doubt that an original was copied because it can be tracked
through its verified source on the blockchain.
NFTs are just starting to be used in the art industry, but many people believe it
has the potential to change how artists create and distribute their work. Just like
3D printing helped revolutionize how people make and distribute their products,
NFTs could be the next big thing in helping creative entrepreneurs share their
work with the world not excluding service rendered companies and organizations
around the globe.`,
  'NFTs & Real Estate': `Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can also be used in the real estate industry. An NFT
is a unique and verifiable representation of something that has value, such as
ownership of property or even documents/contracts that are needed for buying
property. This means you could have fractional ownership to one piece of
property or multiple properties. Imagine being able to buy a share/percentage of
a house, instead of having to buy the entire house which may be out of your
financial reach.
However, Since the evolution of blockchain, we've had tremendous applications
in every industry, even real estate. Blockchain is a triple entry ledger that shows
every transaction on the block, proof of ownership on every block transaction isone of the use cases and benefits of blockchain. Recent real estate uses
blockchain to provide a database of leases and purchases. Upgrading the
traditional Multiple Listing Service (MLS) database to a blockchain-based would
create a far more transparent ledger system where brokers and agents could see
the entire transaction history of a property.
Applying NFTs to blockchain. NFTs are non-fungible tokens or simply put digital
assets in form of art, music, photograph etc. applying this technology might be in
two forms
a. Converting real estate project, or designs to NFT’s, having it in collections to
raise capital for the projects, when the project is executed investors that have this
NFTs can decide to use it as a either make returns by selling it back or giving it
out on lease. This means that the NFts will serve as a proof of ownership of a
particular property.
b. Applying the art part to it. Artmemoir converting real time African monastery
buildings converted to NFTs to promote the almost the outdated African art in
buildings to revive this projects and culture
NFTs can also be used to create trustless transactions between two parties, by
recording contracts on the blockchain. This would remove the need to use a
third party such as a bank or lawyer. An NFT could potentially be used in place
of a title for homeownership, which is typically what people purchase with their
mortgages.
NFTs in the real estate market helps to figure out who owns what and how it can
be transferred from person to person without going through a 3rd party. People
need to have a clear understanding of how they work and that they have value
outside of being used as a digital currency. The benefits of NFTs outweigh the
costs, so they are of great value in real estate transactions.
NFTs can be used to track ownership and royalties, which is useful for all types of
creative industries, including the real estate industry.
Here is what Larry Sanger has to say about NFTs use case in the real estate
industry"Buying real estate is going to move from being this massive technical
undertaking that individuals don't understand...to something super easy." - Larry
Sanger, co-founder of Wikipedia`,
  'NFTs & Games': `NFTs have been a major force in the gaming industry's development.
Non-fungible tokens have elevated the game to an entirely new level! When you
purchase an NFT, you own it for the rest of your life. It will never be taken away
from you by another gamer. The ability to collect, trade, and sell items have not
only increased player engagement but also drive sales for publishers. A
significant surge in revenue has been seen in "Player against Player" games
such as League of Legends, which has generated more than $3 billion in
revenue only from "Cosmetic Items." When you consider that Player vs
Environment games such as World of Warcraft don't allow the trading of items,
this number is even more impressive."`,
  'Art Memoir Services': `As stated in our slogan exploring the world of art beyond beautification through nfts. We have
been a supporter and great lover of art and we have ventured into the minting of nfts with over
